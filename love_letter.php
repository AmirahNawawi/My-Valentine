                To my dearest friends,  
                <br><br>
                I never thought I would meet such an amazing group of people during my diploma studies. I genuinely believed I would be a loner, just like in my high school days. But fate had other plans, and our paths crossed in a way I never expected.  
                <br><br>
                Without realizing it, our friendship has stood the test of time, lasting through all the ups and downs weâ€™ve faced together. Weâ€™ve been through so muchâ€”laughing, crying, and even fightingâ€”but no matter what, we always found our way back to each other.  
                <br><br>
                These two years of friendship have meant the world to me. Thank you for being my support system through every high and low, for sharing countless memories and lessons, and for growing with meâ€”from our teenage years into adulthood. Iâ€™m beyond grateful to have you all in my lifeâ€”my Rahsia Tuhan.
                <br><br>
                I love you guys to the moon and back.
                <br><br>
                Happy Valentineâ€™s Day!
                <br><br>
                Sincerely, your Luna,  
            </p>
